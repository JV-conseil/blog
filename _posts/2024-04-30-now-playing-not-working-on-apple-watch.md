The **[Now Playing][watchos-now-playing]** app _should let_ you control audio playback on Apple Watch, iPhone, and other devices.

Since March 7th, 2024, the [Now Playing][watchos-now-playing] app on my [Apple Watch Series 2][apple-watch-serie-2] displays an endless spinning wheel demonstrating that it cannot connect to my iPhone 14.

### Failed Troubleshooting Attempts üôÖ

1. Switching off the [Apple Watch Series 2][apple-watch-serie-2] and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max did not solve the problem.
2. [Forcing](https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-220564/ "Apple Watch - Force-Quit Apps") the [Now Playing][watchos-now-playing] app to quit did not solve the problem.
3. Toggling the **Auto-Launch Audio Apps** option OFF and then back ON, in the Watch app on the iPhone, under Settings > General > Wake Screen did not solve the problem.
4. [Deleting](https://www.myhealthyapple.com/now-playing-app-not-working-on-apple-watch-lets-fix-it/ "Delete and re-install the Now Playing app") and re-installing the Now Playing app did not solve the problem.
5. [Unpairing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108372 "Unpairing your Apple Watch restores it to its factory settings") the [Apple Watch Series 2][apple-watch-serie-2] and restoring it to its factory settings did not solve the problem.
